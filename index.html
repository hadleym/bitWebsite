            Billy launched the BIT’s legacy podcasts rabbitHOLE and Podcast Town in June 2024, and the inaugural episode of MOVIE! MOVIE! is expected just in time for Spooky Season. 

Also in the BIT pod pipeline is the BIT SPOTLIGHT which will serve as BIT’s experimental stage. Look for iconic team reunions, edgy indie teams, and BIT Crew flexes.

Our ever-growing ensemble is called the BIT CREW. CREW members cycle through four weeks of workshops and then a week of podcast recording. Editing, art, publishing, and distribution are all handled by CREW members.

Please listen, rate, and share your favorite BIT Pods with your friends and family. 

There are multiple ways to get involved – head over to ______ for details.

            Intrigued? Want to join in the fun? Are you envious of this supportive, drama-free community? These are THREE THINGS you can do to participate.

JOIN the ensemble: The BIT Crew welcomes a handful of new members each cycle. If you have a year of long form experience are interested in joining, complete our handy dandy application!

PITCH your indie team: If you have a team with a form that lends itself to a fantastic podcast? Complete the PITCH form and tell us more!

[NOTE: I will create Google forms for the above. Maybe tomorrow? But for sure SOON. The next two will need Billy’s specific approval –still in the concept phase]

NOMINATE yourself or another great improviser to be a guest monologist or honorary crew member in future rabbitHOLE and Podcast Town episodes.

SPONSOR an episode. If you’re not an improviser but LOVE our pods and want to hear your name or business over the interwebs you can sponsor an episode. It’s affordable, fun, and we have overhead to cover!
