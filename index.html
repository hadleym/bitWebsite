            <h2>Billy launched the BIT’s legacy podcasts rabbitHOLE and Podcast Town in June 2024</h2> 
            <p>The inaugural episode of MOVIE! MOVIE! is expected just in time for Spooky Season. </p>

            <p>Also in the BIT pod pipeline is the BIT SPOTLIGHT which will serve as BIT’s experimental stage. Look for iconic team reunions, edgy indie teams, and BIT Crew flexes.</p>

Our ever-growing ensemble is called the BIT CREW. CREW members cycle through four weeks of workshops and then a week of podcast recording. Editing, art, publishing, and distribution are all handled by CREW members.

Please listen, rate, and share your favorite BIT Pods with your friends and family. 

There are multiple ways to get involved – head over to ______ for details.

            Billy Merritt’s entertainment career as an actor, writer, teacher, and producer spans three decades and three markets (New York, Los Angeles, and South Florida).

Billy's affiliation with Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre began at its inception. He is credited with creating numerous UCB shows, including The Documentary, The Improvised One Acts, Murder Murder, The Sunshine Gang, and The Garfunkel. Billy also co-founded and performed with legendary improv troupes: The Swarm and The Stepfathers (New York) and The Smokes (Los Angeles). 

Billy kickstarted a successful television and voice acting career on UCB’s Comedy Central show and made multiple appearances on Late Night With Conan O’Brien, MTV’s Boiling Points, and VH1’s Best Week Ever. 

In Billy’s Los Angeles era, he booked dozens of notable shows, including The Connors, Reno 911, Happy Endings, Weeds, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Workaholics, and many more. 

Billy’s distinctive voice can be heard in many commercials and animated productions. He voices Fryman from Steven Universe (Cartoon Network) and hosts Jameson’s Radio Network. 

A native Floridian, Billy returned to the Sunshine State in 2023 and proudly maintains a Florida Man lifestyle. He quickly infiltrated the local improv scene and performs regularly in Florida, Los Angeles, and across the EU.
